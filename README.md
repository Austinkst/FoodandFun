Unit 7: Project 1

Overview
Welcome to Project 1! This is an important step in your full-stack journey as you will now use your newly acquired skills and knowledge to build web application from scratch. With your team, you will conceive and execute a design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests. Because you will be working collaboratively, you will learn agile development methodologies and implement feature and bug fixes using the git branch workflow and pull requests.
